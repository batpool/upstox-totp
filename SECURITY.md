# Security Policy

Thanks for your interest in keeping this project secure! 🛡️

## Supported Versions

While I strive to keep it up-to-date and safe, security support is **informal** and based on best effort.

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| latest  | ✅        |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do the responsible thing:

- 📧 **Privately report it** to me at [satyabrata.7059@gmail.com](mailto:satyabrata.7059@gmail.com)
- Do **not** open public issues or pull requests for undisclosed vulnerabilities
- I’ll review and respond as soon as possible

## Best Practices

If you fork or reuse this code:
- Always review dependencies
- Do not expose test credentials or debug configs in production
- Follow modern security practices (e.g., HTTPS, input validation, least privilege)

**Let’s keep things secure and respectful. Thanks!** 🙏
