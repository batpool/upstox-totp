# Code of Conduct

Welcome to my project! üêç  

While this is primarily a solo project, I'm always open to collaborating, discussing, and learning together.

I follow the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/) as a baseline for behavior. In short:

- Be respectful.
- Be inclusive.
- Be considerate.
- No harassment, abuse, or discrimination of any kind.

By participating in this repository (issues, pull requests, discussions), you agree to treat others with kindness, professionalism, and empathy.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or observe unacceptable behavior, please feel free to reach out to me directly at [satyabrata.7059@gmail.com](mailto:satyabrata.7059@gmail.com).

Thanks for stopping by and being part of the Pythonic spirit! ‚ú®
